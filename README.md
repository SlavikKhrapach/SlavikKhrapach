- **Tempo App:**
  - Developed an Android app to address a music service need in a church. The app was meant to give fast access to tempos of songs by its number, which significantly reduced the preparation time between songs. It could save, update, and find song information in local SQL database. 
  - I made it using Java, SQL, and Android Studio.
